An Ansible role to manage FreeNAS via API

## Testing

I highly recommend testing prior to running against an existing environment. I
am not responsible for any loss data! This role is still under extensive testing.
To test a setup, I highly recommend using my [FreeNAS Vagrant box](https://github.com/mrlesmithjr/vagrant-box-templates) which is what is being used in developing this role.
